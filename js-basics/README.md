  |A statically-typed language is a language where variable types are known at compile time. In most of these languages, types must be expressly indicated by the programmer; in other cases (such as OCaml), type inference allows the programmer to not indicate their variable types. |Dynamically-typed languages are those where the interpreter assigns variables a type at runtime based on the variable's value at the time.|
